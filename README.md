Decimal odds are a simple reflection of the return you will receive for each single unit placed. For example, let's say bookmaker Matchbook is offering odds of 1.65 for Manchester United to win. This means that for every 1.00 you bet on that particular outcome, you will receive a profit of 0.65 should Manchester United win.

Decimal odds of 2 are equivalent to an implied probability of 50%.

Fractional odds are generally the most traditional form of expressing betting odds. They are a simple reflection of the return you will receive for a particular amount bet.

So for example, let's say bookmaker Ladbrokes is offering odds of 5/2 for a particular horse to win an upcoming race. The odds of 5/2 (expressed as "5 to 2") means that for every 2 units that you bet, you will receive 5 back as profit. So if you bet €200 on that horse, you would have received €500 profit in return plus your original stake of €200.

[Implied Probability] = 1 / [Decimal Odds]
                      = 1 / ([Fractional Odds] + 1)

[Fractional Odds] = [Decimal Odds] - 1
